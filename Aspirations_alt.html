			<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	        	<li>I'm here, priarily, to fill in a skill gap. Scrum/Agile has pretty much ruined me for a traditional project management role. While I could easily continue my career as a non-coding Scrum Master, I'm not enthused about the prospect. Been there, done that and honestly have taken it about as far as I can.</li>
	        	<li>I think I have several career paths that will be open to me after gSchool and I don't want to limit my options at this time.
	        		<ul>
	            		<li>Startup: I have a startup idea that I will be exploring over the next six months. It's probably unrealistic to think that I could launch the business while in G15 but if it passes my due diligence efforts and if I can code up a beta version of the app and get some potential beta customers lined up, I'm reasonably certain that I could secure funding. This is the least likely of my options but also the most exciting. I probably have one more startup gauntlet in me - might as well be my own startup if I can swing it.</li>
	        			<li>Scrum Mastering - I <i>really</i> like Scrum Mastering: It's a very rewarding job for a person with the right personality type (and hell for a person with the wrong personality type). While coding is not truly necessary for Scrum Mastering, a Scrum Master that can code would certainly be more valuable than one that cannot. This is the easiest path forward for me but the least exciting.</li>
	        			<li>Product Ownership: I have had a couple of different mentors advise me that my skill set and personality are well suited for a role in Product. The biggest complaint aired in Scrum circles and forums is the lack of good Product Owners. While Scrum Masters typically come from the roster of Project Managers, Product Owners typically come from the roster of Product Marketers. It's been my experience that these folks have problems relating to the developers and that causes all kinds of problems. A Product Owner that can code AND has experience as a Scrum Master <i>should</i> be a valuable employee. It could be a fun job within the right company.</li>
	        			<li>Scrum Coach: The natural career progression in Scrum from where I am now (CSP) would be to either become a Certified Scrum Trainer (CST) or a Certified Scrum Coach (CSC). Given that I didn't inherit the teaching gene, the CST has little interest to me. Scrum Coaching, however, is interesting to me. This is a longer term goal, as I would need about two-three more years of diligent effort to pass muster as a CSC. I honestly don't think that I could do it well absent good coding skills. This one would almost certainly come in combination with one of the above.</li>
	        		</ul>
	        	</li>	
	        	<li>What do I hope to get out of the gSchool experience? In a word fluency. I have trouble envisioning myself as a full-time coder. I'm not discounting that possibility but the most important thing is fluency in software development.</li>
