        <li>After graduation, I wanted to get out of Montana so I moved to Seattle.</li>
        <li>Wanted to work for REI, which is based in Seattle and was growing rapidly.</li>
        <li>Two ways to get into REI's management track:
          <ul>
            <li>Start as PT sales associate and work your way to mgmt (3 years).</li>
            <li>Get three years of progressive management experience at another retailer.</li>
          </ul>  
        </li>
        <li>The money was better with the latter option, so I got a job at Big-5 Sporting Goods as a manager-trainee.
          <ul>
            <li>Horrible job for me but I did learn how to manage people and deal with people from disparate cultures.</li>
            <li>Stuck it out for the three years but grew weary of Seattle traffic, weather, et al.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>    
        <li>Acquired a taste for craft beer and good coffee.</li>
